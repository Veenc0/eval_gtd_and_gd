  "summary": "This study investigated whether categorization difficulty alone could produce an uncanny valley effect using non-animate geometric shapes.  Three experiments manipulated the morphing percentage of shapes, measuring both categorization response times and likeability ratings.  Results consistently showed slower response times and lower likeability ratings for moderately morphed shapes, replicating the uncanny valley pattern with non-animate stimuli.  However, attempts to improve processing fluency through priming or cues failed to mitigate the negative effect, suggesting that categorization difficulty, rather than processing fluency, is the primary factor. The findings support the categorization-based hypothesis of the uncanny valley, indicating that difficulty in classifying objects contributes to negative affective responses.\n"
