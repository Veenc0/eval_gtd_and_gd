  "summary": "This study investigated whether categorization difficulty, independent of animacy, elicits the uncanny valley effect.  Using morphed geometric shapes, experiments showed that figures taking longer to categorize were rated as less likeable, replicating the uncanny valley phenomenon with non-animate stimuli.  While initially hypothesizing that impaired processing fluency (perceptual and cognitive) underlies this effect, manipulations of fluency did not significantly impact likeability ratings.  The results support the categorization difficulty hypothesis, suggesting animacy is not a necessary condition for the uncanny valley effect. The findings imply that difficulty in categorization, rather than solely impaired processing fluency, contributes to the negative affect associated with the uncanny valley.\n"
