Recently, the emergenceofLargeLanguageModel(LLM)withtheiradvanced understandingandinferencecapabilities,hasintroducedanovel approach. In this work, we investigate the integration of LLM intotheCoverageDirectedTestGeneration(CDG)process,where the LLM functions as a Verilog Reader. It accurately grasps the codelogic,therebygeneratingstimulithatcanreachunexplored codebranches.Wecompareourframeworkwithrandomtesting, using our self-designed Verilog benchmark suite. Experiments demonstratethatourframeworkoutperformsrandomtestingon designs within the LLM\u2019s comprehension scope. Our work also proposes prompt engineering optimizations to augment LLM\u2019s understanding scope and accuracy. Fig. 1: LLM-Aided Hardware Test Generation Workflow.
