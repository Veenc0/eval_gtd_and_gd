  "abstract": "\u2014We feel strong eeriness for non-human objects that not only robotics but also psychology and neuroscience (for are highly similar to humans (a phenomenon known as uncanny reviews, see [3-5]), they could be categorized into an valley). Previous research has accounted for this phenomenon animacy-based model [6-8] or a cognitive-processing-based based on animacy perception (e.g., the avoidance to threat or the model [9]. lack of mind) or cognitive processes irrespective of animacy (categorization difficulty hypothesis). However, whether An animacy-based model hypothesizes that uncanny animacy perception is responsible for uncanny valley to be valley reflects our avoidance (or instinctive threat) to a elicited is unclear at present. This is because all the previous human manque due to the lack of life or mind [1,6-8]. On the studies used objects related to animacy (creature-like features) other hand, a cognitive-processing-based model centers more as stimuli (e.g., faces). Therefore, the present study examined on how we process (or categorize) a human manque [9]. In whether uncanny valley occurs for non-animacy objects, using their study, participants were asked to categorize and evaluate geometric figures (square, circle, and triangle). In Experiment 1, morphed images made from different types of faces (e.g., we made stimulus figures by systematically morphing an original geometrical figure (e.g., circle) into another figure (e.g., cartoon characters and real human). The results showed that triangle). Participants first categorized which original figure morphed images that took longer time to be categorized were (e.g., circle or triangle) the morphed figure was perceived as and rated lower in likeability. They suggested that categorization then evaluated its likability with a 7-point Likert scale. As the difficulty associated with the processing fluency is result, we found the uncanny-valley-like phenomenon with non- responsible for uncanny valley (a categorization-based animacy objects; that is, the figures that took longer times to be hypothesis). categorized (difficult-to-categorize objects) were rated as being less likeable as compared to the figures that were quickly Note that the cognitive-processing-based model (or the categorized (easy-to-categorize objects). The subsequent categorization-based hypothesis) does not premise animacy experiments hypothesized that the categorization difficulty perception, though the previous study [9] used the stimuli deteriorates perceptual and cognitive fluency of the morphed with animacy (or creature-like features). If the categorization- figures, resulting in the lower evaluation for them. To assess this based hypothesis were correct, we could obtain the uncanny- hypothesis, we independently manipulated the perceptual valley-like phenomenon even with the stimuli without (Experiment 2) and cognitive (Experiment 3) fluency of to-be- animacy. The present study examined this point in evaluated figures and investigated how the uncanny-valley-like phenomenon is modulated in response to the processing fluency. Experiment 1. Furthermore, we also investigated whether The results demonstrated the uncanny-valley-like phenomenon, perceptual (Experiment 2) and cognitive (Experiment 3) but no effects of the processing fluency on it. These results fluency associated with the categorization difficulty suggest that the categorization difficulty is one factor underlying contributes to the uncanny-valley-like phenomenon elicited the uncanny-valley-like phenomenon, but the deteriorated by the non-animacy stimuli. processing fluency associated with it does not elicit the phenomenon by itself. We conclude that the uncanny-valley-like phenomenon can be robustly elicited by the stimuli without animacy (or creature-like features), which are in favor with the categorization difficulty hypothesis; that is, animacy perception is not a necessary condition for the occurrence of uncanny valley.
